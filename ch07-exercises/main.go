You have been asked to manage a basketball league and are going to write a program to help you.
Define two types.
The first one, called Team, has a field for the name of the team and a field for the player names.
The second type is called League and has a field called Teams for the teams in
the league and a field called Wins that maps a teamâ€™s name to its number of wins.

Add two methods to League.
The first method is called MatchResult.
It takes four parameters: the name of the first team, its score in the game,
the name of the second team, and its score in the game.
This method should update the Wins field in League.
Add a second method to League called Ranking that returns a slice of the team names in order of wins.
Build your data structures and call these methods from the main function in your program using some sample data.
